## Approach
Our Forum was inspired by classic online forums and message boards like Reddit, Stack Overflow, and InsideHoops. We created an intuitive user-interface while developing our AngularJS skills and practicing working as a group. 

**Features**
Main Page- We decided to limit non-signed in users to only being able to view, sort, filter, and search posts. In the header, there are options for 'Home, 'Sign Up', and 'Login'. Once a user has signed up, they must login to further use the app. Once logged in, the header changes displays to 'Home', 'Profile', and 'Logout' and a user is able to write their own posts, comment on posts, and like posts. We also included both sort and filter options, enabling users to determine which posts they would like to see along with the search capability. 

Profile Page- The profile page allows users to add an URL image for an avatar and update their passwords. It also acts as a users dashboard, displaying the posts they have written and the posts they have interacted with. The profiles of other users are viewable when their username is clicked on in a post and contains similar information as viewing your own profile. 

New Post Page- Users can create their own posts when they are logged in.

We used Bootstraps styling and tried to create a consistent look across all pages. 



## Future Update
- We considered including avatar images alongside posts but were concerned about the sizing in the mobile view. 
- Social media sharing ability for posts.
